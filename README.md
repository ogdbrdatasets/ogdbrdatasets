<h1 align="center"> An Approach to Characterize Open Government Data: A Case from Three Brazilian Public Datasets </h1>
<p align="justify">
The adoption of open government data encourages transparency, participatory governance, and accountability. Achieving these goals depends on the quality of the data.
For example, outdated and uncompleted data may hide accurate analysis. In a previous study, we faced the challenge of manually analyzing Brazilian open government data quality. Manually selecting, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into an appropriate format for analysis requires a representative effort that is error-prone. In this document, we present the details of a semi-automatic approach, including the script for validation and the target metadata from which we characterize the Open Government Data portals.
